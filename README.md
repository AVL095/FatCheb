Estimation of fatigue curves using orthogonal polynomials

The article proposes a methodology for processing the results of fatigue tests in order to assess the parameters of the fatigue curve of materials and structural elements, which is necessary in calculating the service life and reliability of aircraft products, transport engineering and other structures operating under conditions of both regular and irregular loading. A feature of the methodology is the use of orthogonal polynomials in statistical procedures, which can significantly increase the reliability of prediction from the fatigue curve in the area of high durability characteristic of operational load, significantly clarify and simplify the assessment procedure, and reduce durability dispersion. The proposed method is especially effective in conditions of small volumes and censoring of statistical material, uneven duplication of tests according to the levels of cycle stress amplitudes, and a number of other features of fatigue tests.
